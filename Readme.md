# Snake Game

This is a simple snake game implemented in Python. In this game, the player controls a snake-like creature that moves around a window, consuming randomly placed food items. The objective is to avoid colliding with the snake's own tail or the edges of the window while consuming food to increase the snake's length. As the game progresses, the snake becomes longer, making it increasingly challenging for the player.

## Classes

### Food

The `Food` class represents the food items that appear randomly on the game window. When the snake consumes a food item, its length increases.

### Snake

The `Snake` class defines the behavior and appearance of the snake in the game. As the snake moves and consumes food, its length grows.

## Features

- Graphics: The game utilizes graphics to represent the snake and food items on the screen.
- Increasing Difficulty: The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows longer.
- Controls: User controls are implemented to allow players to maneuver the snake within the game window.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake's movement: Up, Down, Left, and Right.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake.
3. Collect food items to increase the length of the snake.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own tail or the edges of the window.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the window edges.

## Difficulty Levels

The game adjusts its difficulty level based on the player's performance, making it progressively harder as the snake grows longer.
